The United States experience a large variety of natural disasters each year: devastating hurricanes, seasonal tornadoes, 
and scorching wild fires are among the events that endanger many lifes and cause billions of dollars in damages. 
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is in charge of "helping people before, during, 
and after disasters" by coordinating disaster response and providing relief funds (see also wikipedia). 
I will update this dataset regularly.
Note, that the data also includes biological disasters, in particular declarations made in response to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.
Therefore, we prepared this model that predicts natural catastrophes with an efficiency of up to 97%.
